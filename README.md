The Sail ISA specification language - Rocq support library
==========================================================

Overview
========

Sail is a language for describing the instruction-set architecture
(ISA) semantics of processors. Sail aims to provide a
engineer-friendly, vendor-pseudocode-like language for describing
instruction semantics. It is essentially a first-order imperative
language, but with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and
bitvector lengths, which are automatically checked using Z3. It has
been used for several papers, available from
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/>.
<p>

This repository contains the Rocq support library for models produced
by Sail for the [Rocq theorem prover](https://rocq-prover.org/)(
previously known as Coq). The
[main Sail repository](https://github.com/rems-project/sail) contains
the Sail tool for processing Sail specifications and translating them
into Rocq.

Installation
============

We suggest using the [opam package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
if you also used it to install Rocq.  See [the instructions on using
opam with Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/docs/installing-rocq) for more
information.  There are two variants which use different bitvector
libraries:

* The `coq-sail-stdpp` package uses the [stdpp
  library's](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp) bitvector package.
  This is the default, but you can also use the `--coq-lib-style
  stdpp` option with Sail to target this package.
* The `coq-sail` package depends on the `coq-bbv` package
  for its implementation of bitvectors.  Use the `--coq-lib-style bbv`
  option with Sail to target this package.  Note that the new Sail
  concurrency interface isn't supported when targeting bbv at the
  moment; please get in touch if you need this.

It's also possible to build the libraries locally with dune. You need to install
either `coq-bbv` or `coq-stdpp-bitvector`, and then respectively
run `dune build @bbv` or `dune build @stdpp`. `dune build` alone will build both
of them. You can run very bare-bones tests for the stdpp version with
`dune build @runtest`

Licensing
=========

The library has the same licensing terms as the main Sail tool.  These
can be found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
