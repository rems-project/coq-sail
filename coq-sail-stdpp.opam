  "Support library for Sail, a language for describing the instruction semantics of processors, using stdpp bitvectors"
description: """
The support library for instruction-set semantics generated from Sail.
Sail is a language for describing the instruction-set
architecture (ISA) semantics of processors. Sail aims to provide a
engineer-friendly, vendor-pseudocode-like language for describing
instruction semantics. It is essentially a first-order imperative
language, but with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and
bitvector lengths, which are automatically checked using Z3. It has
been used for several papers, available from
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/.
The Sail tool can be found in main opam repository."""
